# How I Built A Text Editor Application Using Python Tkinter

Hi! I’m a Python beginner currently taking the 100-day challenge to learn Python concepts.
I’m using tools like Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, and VS Code along the way.
I recently completed a Text Editor App using Python Tkinter!

It’s perfect for writing notes and saving them to read later.
This beginner-friendly project helped me practice GUI development, file handling, and event management, and it also introduced me to the filedialog module in Python.

Want to know how I built it step-by-step? Check out my article on [How I Built A Text Editor Application Using Python Tkinter](https://medium.com/@monalisha1/how-i-built-a-text-editor-application-using-python-tkinter-0067b1af83fc)
