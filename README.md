**How I built a Text- Editor App**

This is a simple Text Editor Application built using Python Tkinter.
Itâ€™s perfect for writing notes and saving them to read later.
This beginner-friendly project helped me practice GUI development, file handling, and event management, while also introducing me to the filedialog module in Python.
